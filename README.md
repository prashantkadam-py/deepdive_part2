# Project1
## Goal1
 We need to create Polygon class with following properties :

 - number of vertices n - passed to the initializer
 - circumradius R - passed to the initializer
 - number of edges
 - number of sides
 - interior angle (in degrees)
 - side length
 - apothem
 - surface area
 - perimeter
 - supports equality (==) based on number of vertices and circumradius
 - supports greater than (>) based on number of vertices

## Goal2
